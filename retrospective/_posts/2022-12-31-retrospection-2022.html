    This year felt more special than any other year. I got a job at a company I was interested in, met great people, and learned a lot of new things from them. And also I felt a lot of lack of myself.
    It's hard to list everything I've felt this year, but I'd like to record some of the most powerful memories.

<h3>God is in debugger !</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    It's no exaggeration to say that 80% of a computational designer's task is debugging. When I was studying algorithms before getting a job, all I did was <code>print()</code> to figure out where the code had problems.
    This method of debugging is very unproductive and takes a long time to troubleshoot. However, if you use a debugger, you can set a <code>break point</code> at the point where the problem occurs, so you can see the problem from the point of view of the bug.

    If a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.debug-visualizer">debugvisualizer</a> is added to this, the geometry developer becomes very productive.

    Architects usually deal with geometry using Rhino's Grasshopper and ghPython. When I didn't know this, I usually worked with ghPython. 
    <br><br>
    But unfortunately, debugger does not exist in ghPython in Rhino.
