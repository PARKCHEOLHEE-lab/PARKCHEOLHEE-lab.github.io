    This year felt more special than any other year. I got a job at a company I was interested in, met great people, and learned a lot of new things from them. And also I felt a lot of lack of myself

    <!-- I started working on <code>January 3, 2022</code>, one year after graduation. 
    Yesterday was the last work day of the year. And today, I would like to look back on the past year. 
    I thought about what I liked, what I learned, what I lacked, and what I longed for from myself in the future. (4L) -->
