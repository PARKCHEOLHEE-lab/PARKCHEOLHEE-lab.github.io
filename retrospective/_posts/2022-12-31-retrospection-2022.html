    This year felt more special than any other year. I got a job at a company I was interested in, met great people, and learned a lot of new things from them. And also I felt a lot of lack of myself.
    It's hard to list everything I've felt this year, but I'd like to record some of the most powerful memories.

<h3>Be the most backward person</h3>

    In the book
    <a href="https://search.shopping.naver.com/book/catalog/32485488809?cat_id=50010920&frm=PBOKPRO&query=%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%EA%B7%B8%EB%9E%98%EB%A8%B8%EC%9D%98+%EA%B8%B8%2C+%EB%A9%98%ED%86%A0%EC%97%90%EA%B2%8C+%EB%AC%BB%EB%8B%A4&NaPm=ct%3Dlcfuagew%7Cci%3Dbdf7db084a13f98ab4b3f983980eb5d612fcaa32%7Ctr%3Dboknx%7Csn%3D95694%7Chk%3Ded8abceed784c60a6d2e77e8a4e6194eeb396e3d">
        The Way of a Programmer, Ask a Mentor

    it is written like this.

    <br><br>
    <blockquote>
        <br>
        Fill your surroundings with people who are better than you. Find a team where you will be the most backward person and where there is room for further growth.
        <br><br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    This means that you should not just stay on the worst, but consciously find ways to improve and imitate the better until you get to the same level as everyone else. Failure to do so will only put a strain on the team.
    I think it means to focus on growth instead of being complacent. Of course, it will be hard to follow, but it is an opportunity for us to grow. It always feels good to think about growth, but on the other hand, ask myself, <code>Am I a good person to work with?</code> makes me think about it. If I'm the most backward person, what can they learn from me?
    <br><br>
    
    What I felt, you must be ready to leave at any time.
    Preparations means things like skills, portfolio, and career. And you should <code>record</code> continuously and fulfil self-correction.

<h3>Speed of learning</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    Someday, I have seen like this interview video. The contents are as follows. The woman in the video is the founder of a company that makes programs for children to learn to code on their own. 
    The point is that the class only teaches simple theory and the process of children practicing is programmed. 
    She says the reason the classes are configured this way is that children all have different levels of learning and each has a different <code>speed of learning.</code>

        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig.2 EO Youtube channel interview</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>
    It was interesting that each of them had a different speed of learning. This doesn't just apply to children. This applies not only to children. Everyone has their own pace, and they learn at their own pace.
    It may be a little slow, and there may be breaks, but I think the important thing is to do it consistently.

<h3>Regulating lines</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    <figure style="margin-top: -1em;">
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83874157/210319104-47cd3ac9-48fc-4709-9535-7f70a67950e9.png" style="width:auto; height:auto;">

    </figure>
    <br>
    All designers, including architects design unconsciously through regulating lines. This serves as a kind of design guideline. So, regulating lines play a very important role in parametric design. 
    <code>Parametric design</code> is not a statically planned design. This is a design in which all design elements respond to parameters and change state. That is, the parameters are interdependent.

    <br><br>
    Regulation lines are a tool to make these parametric models more tightly interdependent. I think one of the important abilities that a computational designer should have is designing regulating lines.

<h3>Methods for quantitative evaluation of physical space</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    A computational designer's most powerful weapon is quantitatively evaluating designs. All designs are not planned just for decoration. 
    The current state of design represents for function and purpose and The function and purpose of the design can be expressed as a score against which the plan can be evaluated. 
    In a broader sense, this can be seen as a design methodology of <code>Form Follows Function.</code>
    What are some factors that can be considered when evaluating the condition of a space? For example, something like this.

    <figure style="margin-top: 2em;">
        <a href="https://issuu.com/brighthope03/docs/portfolio_computational_"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83874157/210356995-72d55bf3-0f41-4cbd-b1a9-52731c9bea47.png" style="width:auto; height:auto;"></a>
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig.4 C-value</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>

    The <code>C-Value</code> seen in the picture above is an index that evaluates the condition of a space such as a theater. 
    The higher the C-Value, the better the viewing conditions. Here, we use the <code>Sight Lines</code> of people sitting in the seats as the regulating lines.

<br><br>

<h3>God is in debuggerüêû</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    It's no exaggeration to say that 80% of a computational designer's task is debugging. When I was studying algorithms before getting a job, all I did was <code>print()</code> to figure out where the code had problems.
    This method of debugging is very unproductive and takes a long time to troubleshoot. However, if you use a debugger, you can set a <code>break point</code> at the point where the problem occurs, so you can see the problem from the point of view of the bug.
    
    If you're a computational designer deal with <code>2D geometry</code>, consider adding a <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.debug-visualizer">debugvisualizer</a>. it would be very productive.

    <figure>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83874157/210215176-f834d0f1-df10-46d9-859f-3f3874d663b0.png" style="width:auto; height:auto;">
        <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Fig.5 Debugger + debugvisualizer combinations</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>
    Architects usually deal with geometry using Rhino's Grasshopper and ghPython. When I didn't know this, I usually worked with ghPython.
    But unfortunately, Rhino's ghPython doesn't have a debugger. So it's too hard to find where is the problem with my script.
    If Rhino included this feature, it would be an even more powerful geometry tool.

<h3>Test code</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    Architecture is parametrically intertwined with various elements. (Core, Parking, Mass etc) That's why, when developing a new feature problems may occur at points related to that feature. 
    Test code helps catch these problems early. 
    <a href="https://search.shopping.naver.com/book/catalog/32455539962?query=%ED%85%8C%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%20%EC%A3%BC%EB%8F%84%20%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C&NaPm=ct%3Dlcftny88%7Cci%3D3ab4a883a516aeb8202f8e26c778e0e182eb99d8%7Ctr%3Dboksl%7Csn%3D95694%7Chk%3Da3dc8fba0c322ad439f80891616af691bed0d9ee">TDD</a>
     is the best development method in terms of CI/CD. However, writing tests involving geometry can take longer than developing new features. Also, there are no best practices to know what is the correct geometry testing method.

    And I'm still not used to it. How can I become fast and proficient? : (
