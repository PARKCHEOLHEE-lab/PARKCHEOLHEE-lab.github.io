                Introduction
            </li>

                    <!-- <li>
                        Manual creation of the floor layout often requires significant time and skills from the
                        architect due to the diversity in the shape of the available space
                        and the constraints that individual rooms must satisfy, such as their
                        sizes and connectivity.
                    </li> -->
                    <li>
                        Recent data-driven methods have employed deep learning to create floor plans. 
                        However, these learning-based methods often fail
                        to support unconventional room shapes and new constraints that are
                        not assumed in a specific training dataset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unfortunately, the existing methods are not suitable 
                        for <i>"free design of the ground plans"</i>
                        advocated by an architect <i>Le Corbusier</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In this paper, we present a <b>differentiable room representation</b>
                        for the flexible generation of floor plans, 
                        while considering various constraints on the shape and connectivity of the room.
                        <mark>
                            Our representation uses the Voronoi diagram to partition the floor into
                            multiple rooms.
                        </mark> 
                        Specifically, <b>one room is defined using multiple Voronoi cells</b> that are implicitly
                        defined based on the distance to the
                        Voronoi sites(centroids of the voronoi cells) and support topology changes,
                        which facilitates flexible exploration of room connectivity
                        during optimization.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Although the Voronoi diagram represents rooms with changing
                        topologies, the unconstrained Voronoi diagram is excessively flexible 
                        to produce plausible floor plans. For instance, a room may be
                        separated into multiple islands or may have unnecessarily complicated wall shapes.
                        <mark>
                            To overcome these issues, we develop 
                            <b>tailored loss functions that encourage rooms to have connected shapes</b> with
                            simple wall shapes.
                        </mark>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In addition, by performing the optimization multiple times with different random initial-
                        izations, the user can efficiently obtain various design options

                                \(\text{(b)}\) the intersection of one bisector and the boundary \(\Omega\),
                                and \(\text{(c)}\) the vertex forming the corner of \(\Omega\).
                                Unlike \(\text{(a)}\) and \(\text{(b)}\), the position of \(\text{(c)}\) does not depend on the Voronoi sites and
                                is constant during our optimization.

                                A typical floor plan is complex and thus its room cannot be represented by
                                a single Voronoi cell. To increase the representation capability, 
                                we combine multiple cells to represent one room (see Fig 1 right-most). 
                                This is concretely achieved by associating each site with one
                                of the rooms, which is determined at the initialization and then remains constant.
