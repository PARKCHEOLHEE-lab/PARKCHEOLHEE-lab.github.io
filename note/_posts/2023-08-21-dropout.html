            <code>torch.nn.Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)</code>

        <li>
            During training, randomly zeroes some of the elements of the input tensor with probability <code>p</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If <code>inplace</code> is set to True, will do this operation in-place

            The concept for killing some nodes and learning (different nodes die for each batch)
            <ul>
                <li>
                    No zeroing when evaluating, testing
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thing to prevent overfitting
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Furthermore, the outputs are scaled by a factor of <code>1 / (1 - p)</code> during training
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The purpose of scaling is to maintain the expected value of each node
                </li>
                <li>
                    When p=0.5, each node has a 50% probability of being disabled
                </li>
                <li>
                    To reward for this, the values of the surviving nodes are scaled by a factor of 2.
