                I would recommend understanding the ML algos at least on a conceptual level. And to use them "raw". It's nowadays quite straightforward with e.g. the transformers-library.

                It's "wise" if you find during your personal hours you are enjoying hacking on it. Before I made the switch, I spent a year studying the material on nights and weekends so that was m my first data point that perhaps this is something I wanted to do full time.

                I transitioned to this in 2018. It was called MLOps. I was a mobile developer before that. Transitioning was pretty easy at that time (it might be more competitive now)

                includes interactive quizzes, fundamentals of vectors/matrices, and a quick intro to PyTorch, an open source ML framework widely used in industry.
