        Programmers are like Gods. 
        They are not big Gods, but pathetic little Gods. 
        Because they have the power of creation. 
        By typing in a series of words and symbols, they can cause something to come to life and it has behavior and it may behave in interesting ways. 
        <span style="color: silver">
            And only we can do that and when you start learning how to do that, I think it changes you.  
        </span>
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
        It may be less true today because they're now people who are forced to do programming 
        <span style="color: silver;">
            because all the other jobs have disappeared and they really don't like it. 
            But they can do it and so they do it. But it used to be nobody did this unless they really wanted to.  
        </span>

    <p>
        And we enjoyed it so much. 
        <span style="color: silver;">
            If we got a job it 
            was like: they're going to pay us to do this?  
            
            This is amazing, right, because we would have 
            done it anyway. We still did it anyway, you know,  
        </span>
    
        I went on vacation and I did programming, 
        I just really enjoyed doing that.
