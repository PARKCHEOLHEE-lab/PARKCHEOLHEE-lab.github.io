        Intersection over Union (IoU)

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>IoU loss</b> \(IoU\) computes the ratio between the intersection and union of the predicted bounding box \(\text{pred}\) and the ground-truth bounding box \(\text{gt}\).
            </li>
            \[
            \text{IoU} = \frac{\text{Area of Intersection}}{\text{Area of Union}} = \,\, \frac{\text{gt} \cap \text{pred}}{\text{gt} \cup \text{pred}}
            \\
            \]
            <li>
                IoU is a good measure of how much the boxes intersect, 
                but it does not describe the distance between the predicted and true bounding boxes 
                when the intersection part is empty. <b>In all empty intersection states, IoU losses are all 0</b> like the right below figure.

            <li>
                <b>DIoU loss</b> addresses this issue by adding a distance term to the IoU loss. The loss is defined as:
            </li>
            \[
                \text{DIoU} = 1 - \text{IoU} + \frac{d^2(c_{\text{gt}}, \,\, c_{\text{pred}})}{diag^2}
            \]

            Where:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    \(c_{\text{gt}}\) and \(c_{\text{pred}}\) are the centroids of the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    \(d(c_{\text{gt}}, \, c_{\text{pred}})\) is the Euclidean distance between the centroids of the boxes
                </li>
                <li>
                    \(diag\) is the diagonal distance of the AABB that contains the two boxes.  
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="/img/iou-2.png" width="30%">

            <br>
            <li>
                The term for square \(^2\) of the \(d\) and the \(diag\) is to emphasize the distance between centroids.
            </li>
            <li>
                The minimum DIoU loss value is 0. This is because, 
                <br>
                When \(\text{IoU} = 1\) (perfectly intersects), the term \(1 - \text{IoU} = 0\). 
                <br>
                When \(d(c_{\text{gt}}, \, c_{\text{pred}} ) = 0\), the distance term equal to \(0\).
                <br>
                Thus, the overall DIoU loss would be \(0\).
                <br>

            </li>
            <li>
                The term for \(\frac{d^2(c_{\text{gt}}, \,\, c_{\text{pred}})}{diag^2}\) is to normalize the distance to 0 ~ 1.
