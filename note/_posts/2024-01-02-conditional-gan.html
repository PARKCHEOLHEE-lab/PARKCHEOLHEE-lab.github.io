                        <mark>By <b>conditioning</b> the model on additional information, it is possible to direct the data generation process.</mark>
                        Such conditioning could be based on <b>class labels</b>, on <b>some part of data</b> for inpainting, or even on data from <b>different modality</b>.

                        In this work we show how can we construct the <b>conditional adversarial net</b>. 
                        And for empirical results we demonstrate two set of experiment. 
                        One on MNIST digit data set conditioned on <b>class labels</b> and one on <a href="https://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/mirdownload.html">MIR Flickr</a> 25,000 dataset for <b>multi-modal learning</b>.
