                Introduction
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        We propose <b>voxel graph</b>, <mark>a novel 3D representation that can encode irregular voxel grids with non-uniform space partitioning.</mark>
                        To bridge between the input program graph and the
                        output voxel graph, we design a pointer-based cross-modal
                        modules in our generative adversarial graph network. The
                        pointer module can be used not only for message passing,
                        but also as a decoder to output probability over a dynamic
                        set of valid programs.

                        In summary, our main contributions are: 
                        1) a new 3D representation, voxel graph;
                        2) a <b>graph-conditioned</b> generative adversarial network (GAN) using GNN and pointer-based cross-modal module;
                        3) an automated pipeline to generate valid volumetric designs through simple interaction;
                        4) a synthetic dataset that contains 120,000 volumetric design and their corresponding program graphs. We will share the code, model, and dataset.

                                Regular grid representation using voxels, such as <b>occupancy grids</b>, 
                                has been studied since the 3D extension of 2D convolution.
                                However, due to the dense representation for sparse
                                occupancy, voxel representation is notorious for its cubic
                                computational cost and poor scalability to higher resolutions and larger sizes.

                                Our proposed voxel graph combines voxel-based and
                                graph-based representations by encoding voxels into graph
                                nodes.
