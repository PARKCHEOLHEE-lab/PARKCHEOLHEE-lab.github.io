                Introduction
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        3D shapes have not gained full benefit from machine learning,
                        despite the vast number of 3D shapes now available on the internet.
                        This is mainly because the machine learning algorithms require
                        the consistent representation of input and output data such as an
                        orthogonally aligned grid (i.e., pixels in the images).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unstructured
                        triangle meshes are the most popular surface representation in
                        the computer graphics, but their topological structures are usually
                        different from one another, hindering the use of machine learning.

                    <li>
                        In this paper, we present a new <b>parameterization technique</b> for
                        efficiently converting a given unstructured mesh into one with a
                        manifold mesh with consistent connectivity using depth information. 
                        We achieve compact and explicit parameterization of a 3D shape by representing the shape as a <b>height field</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The main benefits of our parameterization are the generation ofinput and output data that is ready for machine learning (Figure 1-middle).
                        From many shapes in the same category, our autoencoder network constructs a manifold of these shapes.
                        Using the low dimensional representation from the autoencoder, we can generateand explore a <mark>variation of the 3D shapes at the interactive rate</mark>
