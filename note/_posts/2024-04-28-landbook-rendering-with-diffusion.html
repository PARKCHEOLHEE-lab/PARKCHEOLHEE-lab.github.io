            Rendering test for the building created by Landbook achitecture engine

            Explore prompt to fix for applying it to rendering module
        </li>
        <li>
            Diffuser returns different styles by seed even if uses the same prompt

            <code>simplicity</code> prompt produces results with simpler, solid-color background.

            The keyword for <code>brick facade</code> was used, but the diversity of colors was reduced by keyword for <code>simplicity</code>
        </li>
        <li>
            This way may lead to multi-layer-based rendering as Photoshop
