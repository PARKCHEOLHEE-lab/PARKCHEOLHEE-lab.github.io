                        Graph-structured data is ubiquitous across application domains ranging from chemo- and bioinformatics to image and social network analysis.
                        To develop successful machine learning models in these domains, we need techniques that can exploit
                        the rich information inherent in graph structure, as well as the
                        feature information contained within a graph's nodes and edges.

                        For example, one of the most
                        successful kernel approaches, the <a href="https://process-mining.tistory.com/170">Weisfeiler-Lehman</a> subtree
                        kernel, which is based on the 1-
                        dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic, generates node features through an
                        iterative relabeling, or coloring, scheme.

                    <li>
                        <mark>GNNs can be viewed as a neural version of the WL algorithm, 
                        where colors are replaced by continuous feature vectors 
                        and neural networks are used to aggregate over node neighborhoods.</mark>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In effect, the GNN framework can
                        be viewed as implementing a continuous form of graph-based
                        “<a href="https://process-mining.tistory.com/164">message passing</a>”, where local neighborhood information is
                        aggregated and passed on to the neighbors.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        GNN은 CNN처럼 데이터를 어떻게 집계할 것인가에 관한 것으로 생각하면 될듯? (CNN을 grid-shaped graph로 보고)
                    </li>
                </ul>
