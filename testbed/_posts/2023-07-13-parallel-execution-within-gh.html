<h3>A simple understanding of multiprocessing</h3>
<div class="article">
    Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a computer system to execute multiple processes or tasks concurrently. 
    It involves the use of multiple processors or processor cores to perform multiple tasks <code>simultaneously</code>, thereby improving overall system performance and efficiency.
    
    <br><br>
    In a multiprocessing system, each process is an independent unit of execution with its own program counter, stack, and data section. 
    These <code>processes</code> can run concurrently, allowing for parallelism and efficient utilization of system resources.
    
    <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
        <li>Processes: A process is an instance of a running program. Each process has its own memory space, file descriptors, and system resources. Processes are created and managed by the operating system. <code>They can communicate with each other</code> using inter-process communication mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>    
    
    <br>
    
    You can understand multiprocessing with a very simple example easily. That is the following:
    <!--break-->

<pre class="highlight"><code class="python">
    from multiprocessing import <spab class="method">Pool</spab>, cpu_count
    import <span class="defName">time</span>
    
    def <span class="defName">f</span>(x):
        time.<span class="defName">sleep</span>(1)
        return x*x
    
    def <span class="defName">parallel_execution</span>(max_range):
        start = time.time()
        with <span class="method">Pool</span>(processes=cpu_count()) as p:
            x_squared = p.<span class="defName">map</span>(f, range(max_range))
    
        parallel_time = time.time() - start
        print(f"Parallel execution time: {parallel_time}")      
        
        return x_squared
    
    def <span class="defName">sequential_execution</span>(max_range):
        start = time.time()
        x_squared = []
        for x in range(max_range):
            x_squared.<span class="defName">append</span>(f(x))
    
        sequential_time = time.time() - start
        print(f"Sequential execution time: {sequential_time}")  
    
        return x_squared
    
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':

        max_range = 10
        x_squared_parallel = <span class="defName">parallel_execution</span>(max_range)
        x_squared_sequential = <span class="defName">sequential_execution</span>(max_range)

        <span class="annotation"># Parallel execution time: 1.8122541904449463</span>
        <span class="annotation"># Sequential execution time: 10.073817014694214</span>
</code></pre>

<br>
The <code>parallel_execution</code> and <code>sequential_execution</code> functions use <code>f(x)</code> in common,
return a squared value about given x after wating 1 second (sleep). 
Thus in the sequential function, you have to wait <code>at least max_range * 1</code> seconds before getting the result (On my computer, it took 10.073817014694214 seconds).
<br><br>
On the other hand, the parallel function took 1.8122541904449463 seconds. 
Because it executes simultaneously as much as <code>cpu_count</code>, you don't have to wait <code>max_range * 1</code> seconds.

<h3>Improving performance of the real algorithm</h3>
<div class="article">
    Now, let's improve the performance of a real algorithm by applying multiprocessing (This task corresponds to defining f(x) you saw above).
    There is the algorithm that finds <code>MIR</code> (Maximal Inner Rectangle) for a given polygon like the following.
    <figure>
        <img src="/img/parallel-1.gif" width="100%" onerror=handle_image_error(this)>
        <figcaption>Algorithm for finding MIR</figcaption>
    </figure><br>

    This algorithm approximates the maximal rectangle within a given polygon based on rotation interval degree and grid size.
    Smaller values for <code>rotation interval degree</code> and <code>grid size</code> result in more accurate rectangles, but slower.

    <br><br>

    This algorithm is based on rotating a polygon at input rotation intervals and creating a binary grid (AABB axes-aligned).
    That is, the same logic is executed at all rotation intervals. At this point, we can write the code for finding MIR with <code>parallelism</code> in mind. That's the following.

<pre class="highlight"><code class="python">
    def <span class="defName">_generate_maximal_inner_rectangle</span>(
        self, polygon, rotation_degree, grid_size, is_strict
    ):
        <span class="annotation">"""Estimates the maximum inner rectangle of the given polygon by `rotation_degree` and `grid_size`

        Args:
            polygon (Rhino.Geometry.PolylineCurve): polygon to estimate
            rotation_degree (float): rotation step
            grid_size (float): size of the grid each cell
            is_strict (bool, optional): if true, only uses fully inner cells. Defaults to False.

        Returns:
            Rhino.Geometry.PolylineCurve: estimated maximal rectangle

        """</span>

        anchor = rg.AreaMassProperties.Compute(polygon).Centroid
        mir_args_list = []

        each_degree = 0
        while each_degree <= 359:
            each_args = []

            each_angle = math.radians(each_degree)

            rotation_transform = rg.<span class="method">Transform</span>.<span class="method">Rotation</span>(each_angle, anchor)
            rotated_polygon = copy.copy(polygon)
            rotated_polygon.<span class="method">Transform</span>(rotation_transform)

            each_args = [
                rotated_polygon,
                anchor,
                each_angle,
                grid_size,
                is_strict,
            ]

            mir_args_list.append(each_args)

            each_degree += rotation_degree
        
        <span class="annotation"># Parallel execution</span>
        if self.is_parallel:
            mirs = ghpythonlib.parallel.<span class="defName">run</span>(self.<span class="defName">_get_each_mir</span>, mir_args_list, True)
        
        <span class="annotation"># Sequential execution</span>
        else:
            mirs = [self.<span class="defName">_get_each_mir</span>(each_args) for each_args in mir_args_list]
        
        mir = max(
            list(mirs), key=lambda m: rg.AreaMassProperties.Compute(m).Area
        )

        return mir
</code></pre><br>

For one's information, GhPython has no multiprocessing module, so you can parallelize it by using <code>ghpythonlib.parallel</code> module.
Perhaps GhPython is Iron Python implemented by .NET Framework, so you could use the multiprocessing module used in C#.

<h3>Comparing execution time</h3>
<div class="article">
    On my computer, I got the following reuslts. When run in parallel, it takes 1.9735183715820313. And run in sequential, it takes 8.2854690551757813.
    In the case of parallel processing, the result can be obtained <code>4x</code> times faster. If you have more inputs, you can expect a bigger performance boost.
