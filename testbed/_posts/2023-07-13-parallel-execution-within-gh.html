<h3>A simple understanding of multiprocessing</h3>
<div class="article">
    Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a computer system to execute multiple processes or tasks concurrently. 
    It involves the use of multiple processors or processor cores to perform multiple tasks <code>simultaneously</code>, thereby improving overall system performance and efficiency.

    <br><br>
    In a multiprocessing system, each process is an independent unit of execution with its own program counter, stack, and data section. 
    These <code>processes</code> can run concurrently, allowing for parallelism and efficient utilization of system resources.

    <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
        <li>Processes: A process is an instance of a running program. Each process has its own memory space, file descriptors, and system resources. Processes are created and managed by the operating system. <code>They can communicate with each other</code> using inter-process communication mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>    

    <br>
    The below code is a very simple example of multiprocessing:
<pre class="highlight">
    import time
    from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count
    
    def f(x):
        time.sleep(1)
        return x*x
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        
        max_range = 10
        
        start = time.time()
        with Pool(processes=cpu_count()) as p:
            x_squared = p.map(f, range(max_range))
        parallel_time = time.time() - start
        
        start = time.time()
        x_squared = []
        for x in range(max_range):
            x_squared.append(f(x))
    
        sequential_time = time.time() - start
    
        print(f"Parallel execution time: {parallel_time}")      
        print(f"Sequential execution time: {sequential_time}")  

        # Parallel execution time: 1.8122541904449463
        # Sequential execution time: 10.073817014694214
</pre>
