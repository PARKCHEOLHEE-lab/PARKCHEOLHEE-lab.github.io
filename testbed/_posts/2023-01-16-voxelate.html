<h3>What is a Voxel ? ðŸ§Š</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    In computer graphics, a <a href="https://www.megavoxels.com/learn/what-is-a-voxel/">voxel</a>, also known as a 3D pixel, is a 3D cube located on a three-dimensional grid used to create 3D models. 
    Similar to a pixel in a 2D image, a voxel can contain a specific location inside a <code>3D grid</code> and has a color value assigned to it. 
    All individual voxels are the same size, however voxels can then be combined in the same grid at different positions with different colors to create what is known as a voxel model.

    In addition, a voxel is also used as the smallest unit composing an architectural space. This is because <code>voxels have no deadspace</code> and can be used for all architectural purposes and reasonable.
    Therefore It's being used in many architectural offices. The process of architecture below shows how to apply <code>voxelization to the building.</code>
    This article covers automation of voxelization and how change to the voxelated shape when given specific shape. And let's put some information in the voxel.

<h3>3D grid & conditions map</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    First we should create <code>grids</code> and to create a grid, need a bounding box of given shape. The angle of bounding box sets sun faced like the <code>picture 4</code> above.
    Through the segments X and Y of the bounding box facing the sun, we can get a 3D voxel grid of the desired size that fully fills the bounding box. 
    Then we check if the voxel is inside the given shape, <code>filter only the voxel that is inside the shape.</code> 
    <br><br>
    This grid of voxels can be represented as a <code>List,</code> one of Python's data structures. And the data structure List can express <code>multi-dimensional</code> data.
    Let's take a look at a simple example below. 
    <br><br>
    The given simple conditions are as follows. <i>â‘  voxel size: 2.0 â‘¡ given shape: sphere that radius: 20.0</i>. As mentioned earlier, in the last picture below you can see the voxel data structure represented as a List in Python.
    Data of <code>0</code> means empty voxels and data of <code>1</code> means filled voxels.
    Now, we can determine each voxel condition through the data we have. Examples include <code>interior voxels, exterior voxels, corner voxels, and roof voxels</code> etc.
