<h3>Introduction 🔗</h3>
<div class="article">
    This project explores the key contributions of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13316">Building-GAN</a> by AutodeskAILab: 
    1) a novel 3D representation called <strong>voxel graph</strong> that can encode <strong>irregular voxel grids</strong> with non-uniform space partitioning, overcoming limitations of traditional regular voxel grids, and 
    2) a graph-conditioned generative adversarial network (GAN) leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs). 
    The implementation uses their <a href="https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/Building-GAN?tab=readme-ov-file">dataset</a> to study these approaches.

<h3>Data Structure</h3>
<div class="article">

    In the Data Collection part of the paper, it says that the dataset was created as follows:
    <br><br>
    Since there is no publicly available dataset for volumetric designs from real buildings, we create a synthetic
    dataset with 120,000 volumetric designs for commercial buildings using parametric models. 
    The heuristics behind the parametric models are based on the rules and knowledge provided by professional architects. 
    
    <!--break-->
    
    Although these parametric models are able to explore possible volumetric designs, they are not capable of fitting the constraints.
    Therefore, we generate the designs first and then compute the voxel graph, program graph, FAR, and TPR for each design.

        실제 생성된 데이터 구성을 살펴보면 3 가지의 json이 하나의 datum을 나타냅니다. 
        - local_*.json
        - global_*.json
        
            "far": 3.1144640998959425,
            "global_node": [
                {
                    "type": 3,
                    "proportion": 0.04811226194453724,
                    "connection": [[0, 3, 0], [1, 3, 1], [0, 3, 1], [3, 3, 1], [1, 3, 0], [2, 3, 0], [3, 3, 0], [2, 3, 1]]
                },
                
                (...)
            ]
        - voxel_*.json

        따라서 우리가 살펴볼 부분은 progra graph와 voxel graph입니다. 

        Each datum used in the paper consists of a Hierarchical Program Graph and a Voxel Graph.

        voxel의 프로그램은 크게 6가지로 구성되어 있고, void에 해당하는 부분은 -1로 표현되어 있습니다.
        
        Here, we consider
        6 program types: lobby/corridor, restroom, stairs, eleva-
        tor, office, and mechanical room.

        논문에서 데이터는 크게 Hierarchical Program Graph, Voxel Graph로 로 구성됨

        
        Since there is no publicly available dataset for volu-
        metric designs from real buildings, we create a synthetic
        dataset with 120,000 volumetric designs for commercial
        buildings using parametric models.

        Each program node feature includes
        the program type and the story level.

<h3>Representing Voxel as Graph</h3>
<div class="article">
    <!-- 
        each voxel has unique index:
            (0,0,0) -> 0
            (0,0,1) -> 1

                (...)

            (n,m,o) -> ?

        if voxels have the same assignment and are adjacent to each other,
        it means that they are connected in the graph representation
