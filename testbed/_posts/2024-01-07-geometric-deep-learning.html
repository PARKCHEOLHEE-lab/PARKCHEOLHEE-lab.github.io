<h3>Introduction ðŸ’¡</h3>
<div class="article">
    This project was initiated by curiosities about the <code>intersection of geometric data and optimization</code> within the realm of machine learning:

    <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
        <li class="decimal">Can the geometric properties of data enhance model performance?</li>
        <li class="decimal">Can models converge faster if optimizers have geometric losses?</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    Based on the above questions, let us observe the concept of geometric loss simply:

    <br><br>

    The concept of geometric loss is grounded in the idea that understanding and leveraging the geometric properties of data is important.
    This understanding and leveraging can significantly enhance model performance, especially in tasks where the spatial arrangement and relationships between data points are crucial.
    
    
    <br><br>
    
    Geometric losses <code>incorporate geometric principles of data into the learning process.</code> 

    <!--break-->

    This approach enables models to recognize and preserve the underlying geometric structures of the dataset.
    
    For instance, in tasks involving images, shapes, or graphs, where the spatial relationships and configurations are essential, geometric losses help in capturing these nuances more effectively than traditional methods.

<h3>Problem definition</h3>
<div class="article">

    To experiment with the above questions in the Introduction part, 
    let me define a simple geometric problem. 
    It is to find the <code>largest inscribed rectangle</code> on a given 2d polygon like the following.
    <br><br>

    </figcaption>

    <br><br>

    After defining a geometric problem, I defined the algorithm for finding <a href="https://github.com/PARKCHEOLHEE-lab/toytorch/blob/766853852c332c66decf3478eace9fd034c0602d/lirGAN/data/largest_inscribed_rectangle.py#L12-L133">LIR</a>.
    In this algorithm, a given polygon is represented as a <code>binary grid</code> of 1s and 0s.
    1 is represented as a solid part and 0 is represented as a void part. 
    The following representation of a binary grid-shaped polygon has 100 x 100 grid size. If the size is higher, it can be represented more precisely.

<h3>Data preparation</h3>
<div class="article">

    We have set up a problem and a way to represent geometric data to experiment with the problem in the above section. 
    In this part, we create a dataset to train a generator that estimates the <code>LIR</code> given an input polygon.
