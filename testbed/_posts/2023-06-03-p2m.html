<h3>Edge detection</h3>
<div class="article">
    <!-- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection">Edge detection</a> includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying edges, 
    curves in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities. -->

    Edge means a boundary line or an outline. An edge in an image refers to a portion existing at a point where the brightness of an image changes from a low value to a high value or vice versa.
    Ultimately, an edge indicates the boundary of an object in an image and contains various information such as shape and direction detection.

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection">Edge detection</a> is the process of finding a pixel corresponding to an edge.
    And it includes a variety of mathematical methods that aim at identifying edges, curves in a digital image at which the image brightness changes sharply or, more formally, has discontinuities.
