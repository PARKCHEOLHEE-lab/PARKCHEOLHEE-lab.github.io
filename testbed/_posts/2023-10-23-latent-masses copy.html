    1. 3D shape representation for the generative adversarial networks
        - point cloud
        - mesh
        - voxel 

    2. Proof of concept: training and generating a sphere 
        - preprocessing data
            . normalizing
            . sampling randomly
            . training process per 100 epoch -> .gif

    3. Implementing MassGAN
        - Use voxel representation
            . the voxel is appropriate in the architectural field. because it has no deadspace ...
        
        - Preparing data that is shaped mesh and converting them to binary voxel grid
        - training
            . training process per 100 epoch -> .gif

    4. Exploring latent masses between multiple masses generated
        - interpolating process -> .gif
