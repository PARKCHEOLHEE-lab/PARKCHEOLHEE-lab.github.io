<h3>When thinking of data as space, intuition works 💡</h3>
<div class="article">

    We live in a three-dimensional space. To handle problems in a 3D world, we need terms that describe this 'space' well. 
    Examples include computer graphics, car navigation, and games. 
    The vector spaces in linear algebra abstract certain properties of our real space. Therefore, linear algebra provides convenient terms and concepts to describe space. 
    For instance, if you're thinking about 'how to draw a 3D object on a 2D plane,' you encounter the problem of 'what 2D image appears when you move and rotate the viewpoint in 3D space.' 
    Linear algebra plays a fundamental role in solving such problems.

    <br><br>
    
    However, we don't learn linear algebra just to solve problems in space.

    <br><br>
    
    You'll often want to handle data composed of multiple numbers, not just single values. 
    These cases might not be directly related to 'space,' so you can handle them without explicitly thinking about 'space.' 
    But if you interpret this data as 'points in high-dimensional space,' you can use your <code>spatial intuition</code>.

    <br><br>
    
    Although we can only recognize three-dimensional space, many 'general n-dimensional phenomena' can be intuitively understood by <code>inferring</code> from three-dimensional space. 
    This interpretation is effective in data analysis. When it comes to 'space' problems, linear algebra steps in.

<h3>Vector and Space</h3>
<div class="article">
    <br>
    <b>🧬 Basis</b><br>
    A basis is a set of vectors that defines a <code>coordinate system</code> for a vector space. By choosing a set of basis vectors, we can specify the position of any vector within that space relative to these basis vectors.<br><br>
    For example, consider the standard basis vectors \( \mathbf{e_1} \) and \( \mathbf{e_2} \) in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \). 
    These vectors form a convenient coordinate system. Any vector \( \mathbf{v} \) in this space can be expressed as a <code>linear combination</code> of these basis vectors.
    This means \( \mathbf{v_1} \) can be decomposed into 2 units of \( \mathbf{e_1} \) and 3 units of \( \mathbf{e_2} \). <br>
    
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">\( \mathbf{e_1} = [1, 0]^T \) <br> \( \mathbf{e_2} = [0, 1]^T \)</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">\( \mathbf{v_1} = [2, 3]^T = 2\mathbf{e_1} + 3\mathbf{e_2} \) <br> \( \mathbf{v_2} = [3.3, 1.3]^T = 3.3\mathbf{e_1} + 1.3\mathbf{e_2} \)</p>

    <br><br><br>

    Basis vectors do not need to be <code>orthogonal</code> or have unit length. Let's consider a different set of basis vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \)!
    We can express any vector in terms of these new basis vectors with the below specific basis. Here, \( \mathbf{v_2} \) is decomposed into 1.2 units of \( \mathbf{e_1} \) and 2.7 units of \( \mathbf{e_2} \). 
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">\( \mathbf{e_1} = [1, -0.1]^T \) <br> \( \mathbf{e_2} = [1, 1]^T \)</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 2em;">\( \mathbf{v_1} = [4, 1.8]^T = 2\mathbf{e_1} + 2\mathbf{e_2} \) <br> \( \mathbf{v_2} = [3.9, 2.58]^T = 1.2\mathbf{e_1} + 2.7\mathbf{e_2} \) </p>

    <b>🧬 Conditions for becoming Basis</b><br>
    In linear algebra, a basis for a vector space is a set of vectors that satisfy two fundamental conditions:

    <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
        <li class="decimal">
            <b>Spanning the Vector Space</b>:
            A set of vectors spans a vector space if every vector in that space can be expressed as a <code>linear combination</code> of the vectors in the set. 
            This means that any vector in the space can be reached by scaling and adding the basis vectors. 
        </li>
        <li class="decimal">
            <b>Linear Independence</b>: 
            The vectors in the set must be linearly independent, which means that no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. 
            Put simply, each vector creates a <code>unique</code> dimension to the space that cannot be duplicated by any combination of the other vectors.
        </li>
    </ul><br>

    Imagine a vector space as a room, and the basis vectors as different directions you can travel within that room. 
    If you can move in every possible direction (<code>span</code>), then the basis vectors cover the entire space.

<h3>Matrix and Mapping</h3>
<div class="article">
    When an \( m \times n \) matrix \( A \) is multiplied by an \( n \)-dimensional vector \( x \), 
    an \( m \)-dimensional vector \( y = Ax \) is obtained. 
    In other words, specifying matrix \( A \) determines a mapping that transforms one vector into another. 
    In fact, this is the most important role of a matrix. 
    From now on, when you see a matrix, do not simply think of it as a collection of numbers, 
    but rather as a given <code>mapping</code>.
