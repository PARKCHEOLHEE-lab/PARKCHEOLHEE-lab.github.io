<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div class="article">

    
    
    This project aims to develop an interior scene generation system, funded by KOCCA, that converts single interior images into structured 3D scenes.
    By combining state-of-the-art models for 2D object detection, automatic mask and semantic segmentation, 
    and single-view image-to-3D reconstruction, the pipeline automatically identifies 
    and segments all interior elements from a single input photo, 
    reconstructs each detected object as an aligned, textured 3D mesh, and assembles them coherently into a recreated scene.
    Applications range from virtual walkthroughs and editing to AR/VR staging and interior design automation.
