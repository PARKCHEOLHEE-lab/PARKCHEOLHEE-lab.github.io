<h3>Introduction 🔗</h3>
<div class="article">
    This project explores the key contributions of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13316">Building-GAN</a> by AutodeskAILab: 
    1) a novel 3D representation called <strong>voxel graph</strong> that can encode <strong>irregular voxel grids</strong> with non-uniform space partitioning, overcoming limitations of traditional regular voxel grids, and 
    2) a graph-conditioned generative adversarial network (GAN) leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs). 
    The implementation uses their <a href="https://github.com/AutodeskAILab/Building-GAN?tab=readme-ov-file">dataset</a> to study these approaches.

<h3>Raw Data</h3>
<div class="article">

    In the Data Collection part of the paper, it says that the dataset was created as follows:
    <br><br>
    Since there is no publicly available dataset for volumetric designs from real buildings, we create a synthetic
    dataset with 120,000 volumetric designs for commercial buildings using parametric models. 
    The heuristics behind the parametric models are based on the rules and knowledge provided by professional architects. 
    
    <!--break-->
    
    Although these parametric models are able to explore possible volumetric designs, they are not capable of fitting the constraints.
    Therefore, we generate the designs first and then compute the voxel graph, program graph, FAR, and TPR for each design. 

    (...)
    
    <strong>Here, we consider 6 program types: lobby/corridor, restroom, stairs, elevator, office, and mechanical room.</strong> 
    Each program node feature includes the program type and the story level.

    <br><br>

    Each datum of the created dataset consists of three JSONs as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>graph_global_*.json</strong>: 
            contains the FAR (Floor Area Ratio), program ratios, and program types (6 program types described above + void type).

            floor \(\text{F}\) (the floor level on which the node is placed), 
            program type \(\text{T}\), index \(\text{I}\), and neighbors that indicate connectivity between nodes.
            In the local graph, the unique index of each node is created as \(\text{[F, T, I]}\), 
            and the neighbors contain these unique indices.
            In the example below, the first node's unique index is \(\text{[0, 3, 0]}\), 
            and it has \(\text{[1, 3, 0]}\) as a neighbor. 
            Similarly, the node with index \(\text{[1, 3, 0]}\) has \(\text{[0, 3, 0]}\) as a neighbor.

<h3>Representing Voxels as a Graph</h3>
<div class="article">

    
    A Graph data structure consists of vertices and edges \(G(V, E)\).
    The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes 
    and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

    The graph data structure can be represented as an adjacency list (or matrix) to indicate connectivity between nodes.

    <br><br>

    To convert voxel data into a graph structure, we need to assign an index for each voxel.
    The index of each voxel is \(\text{(x, y, z)} \)-shaped structure, and it is unique, so that the index can be converted to \(\text{(0, 1, 2,} \cdot \cdot \cdot \text{, n)} \)-shaped structure.
    As each voxel is a node, the last index of the node is the number of voxels-1.

    <br><br>
    
    Since the voxel is a cuboid-shaped geometry, connectivity between voxel nodes can be determined by the 3D 6-way connectivity.
    In the figure below, let's see the uppermost voxel with index \(319\) of the right diagram.
    
    Among the six faces of this voxel, only three (right, front, and bottom) are connected to adjacent voxels.
    The other faces do not touch any neighboring voxels. According to the 3D 6-way connectivity system, the node with index \(319\) has neighbor nodes with indices \(255\), \(311\), and \(318\).
    Therefore, using the adjacency list representation, it can be expressed as \(\text{319: [255, 311, 318]}\).

    Similarly, by the same logic, the node with index \(24\) has faces that are adjacent to four voxels located to the left, right, front, and top.
    Therefore, using the adjacency list representation, it can be expressed as \(\text{24: [16, 25, 32, 88]}\).

    <br><br>

    In this system, <b>the number of neighboring voxel nodes is at least 3 and at most 6</b>, since a voxel is a cuboid-shaped geometry with 6 faces.

    <br><br>

            From the left, Unique Index · Adjacency List Representation
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <br><br>

    Each node in the graph data has the same shape features as other nodes.
    As I mentioned above, each voxel is converted into a node, so the node's features are the voxel's geometric attributes.

    In the raw data, each voxel node has the following features: coordinate \((3)\), dimension \((3)\), and location \((3)\) 
    (<code>voxel_graph_features</code> is a flattened vector \((9)\) containing all three).
    Additionally, the FAR \((1)\) feature from <strong>graph_global_*.json</strong> and the floor level \((1)\) of each voxel are combined as part of the node features.
    The final feature vector of each node has a length of \((11)\); therefore, each graph is represented as an \((\text{N}, 11)\)-shaped matrix, where \(\text{N}\) is the number of nodes.

    <br><br>

    Here, I will skip the details of processing the local graph. 
    You can find the code for processing the local graph at this <a href="https://github.com/PARKCHEOLHEE-lab/building-gan-graph-conditioned-architectural-volume-generation/blob/main/building_gan/src/data.py#L16-L41">link</a>.

    Here, since PyTorch Geometric is used for training models with graphs, 
    node features and the connectivity between nodes are represented as <code>x</code> and <code>edge_index</code>, respectively.

    Each graph is instantiated by <code>Data</code> of PyTorch Geometric.
    The raw data, excluding <code>x</code> and <code>edge_index</code>, can also be passed as kwargs to be used during training or evaluation.
    The thing to note is that, in training with graphs, mini-batching is performed at the node level. 
    Therefore, you must ensure that each data field matches the number of nodes; otherwise, problems may occur during batching.

<h3>Modeling</h3>
<div class="article">

    The GNN model can be broadly divided into link prediction and node classification tasks.
    In the paper, the model generates voxels given a local graph and a voxel graph, so the task corresponds to node prediction.
