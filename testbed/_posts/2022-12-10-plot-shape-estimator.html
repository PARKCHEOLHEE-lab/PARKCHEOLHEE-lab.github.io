<h3>How many shapes does the plot have ? üè∑Ô∏è</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>

    The shape of the plot in Seoul is diverse. There are <code>flags, squares, long-squares, trapezoids, triangles</code> and other shapes that are hard to define. building will exists within the plot.
    Since architects design within a given plot, the direction of design may change depending on the shape of the site.
    <br><br>

    The architect empirically judges the shape of plot and develops the design. In the case of too long-square shapes, the architect will scale the building down in the direction of the long side axis.
    If given a triangle shapes of land, architects design it to eliminate acute angles. In this way, people can subjectively <code>judge</code> the type and <code>define</code> the shape.

    So how can a computer determine and define the shape of plot? In this article, I analyze how computers can determine the shape of plot and develop designs.

<h3>Properties of the plot</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>
    Plot is a individual 2D geometry. And expressions such as long, short, round, and pointed are related to the properties of geometry.
    So then, How to make computers understand like these properties? First, we need to <code>define the properties</code> of the plot.
    I'll look at the most common plots. The most common shapes of plots are shown below.

    The square shape and long square shape can be defined based on: aspect ratio, sum of interior angles(360'), bounding box ratio, etc. Similarly, the shape of a triangle can be also defined as the sum of interior angles(180').
    In general, the feature of a flag shape is that the shape obtained by subtracting the flag shape itself from its convex hull is a triangle. 
    Lastly, the trapezoid shape can be defined as the number of triangles obtained by subtracting the trapezoid shape from its bounding box.
