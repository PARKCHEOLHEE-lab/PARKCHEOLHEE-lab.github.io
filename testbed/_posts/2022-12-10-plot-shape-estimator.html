<h3>How many shapes does the plot have ?</h3>
<div style='text-align: justify;'>

    The shape of the plot in Seoul is diverse. There are <code>flags, squares, long-squares, trapezoids, triangles</code> and other shapes that are hard to define. building will exists within the plot.
    Since architects design within a given plot, the direction of design may change depending on the shape of the site.
    <br><br>

    The architect empirically judges the shape of plot and develops the design. In the case of too long-square shapes, the architect will scale the building down in the direction of the long side axis.
    If given a triangle shapes of land, architects design it to eliminate acute angles. In this way, people can subjectively <code>judge</code> the type and <code>define</code> the shape.
