<h3>What is a Quadtree ?</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    A <code>Quadtree</code> is a data structure in which each internal node has exactly <code>four children.</code>
    Quadtrees are most used to partition a 2D space by recursively subdividing it into quadrants.
    The subdivided regions may be square or rectangular, or may have arbitrary shapes.

    <br><br>    
    All forms of quadtrees share some common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">features</a>: <br>
    <ul style="padding-left: 2em;">
        <li>They decompose space into adaptable cells</li>
        <li>Each cell (or bucket) <code>has a maximum capacity.</code> When maximum capacity is reached, the bucket <code>splits (or subdivides)</code></li>
        <li>The tree directory follows the spatial decomposition of the quadtree</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Edge quadtree</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    Edge quadtrees are used to store <code>lines.</code> 
    The difference is the type of information stored about the cells.
    Curves are approximated by subdivided cells to a very fine resolution, specifically until there is a single line segment per cell.
    Near corners/vertices, edge quadtrees will continue dividing until they reach their <code>maximum level</code> of decomposition.
    This can result in extremely unbalanced trees.

    <br><br>

    There is an interesting diagram regarding Edge quadtree. Here, the <code>k</code> is may be infinite.
    That's why, as mentioned above you should designate the maximum level of decomposition.

<h3>Implementation</h3>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
    Now, let's implement it using GhPython based on the explanations above.

    First, define the <code>quadtree</code> class and takes <code>bounding_box</code> and <code>min_size</code> as input values.
    The <code>min_size</code> is used as the maximum level of decomposition as mentioned above.

<pre>
    class Quadtree:
        COUNTER = 1

        def __init__(self, bounding_box, min_size=2):
            self.bounding_box = bounding_box
            self.min_size = min_size

            self.crvs = []
            self.children = None
            self.children_geometries = None
    
            self._post_init()
</pre>
    Quadtree has a root node, middle node, and leaf node because its data structure is based on a node.
    If cannnot subdivide no more, children will be <code>None</code>, else other Quadtree objects.

    <br><br>

    In the <code>crvs</code> instance variable of the quadtree, the line segments included in each quadtree rectangle are stored.
    The <code>COUNTER</code> class variable that the quadtree has, is used as a flag to subdivide when each region of the quadtree contains a curve.
