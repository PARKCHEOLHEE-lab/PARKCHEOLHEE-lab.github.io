<h3>Introduction 🏢</h3>
<div class="article">

    <code>Deep Generative AI</code>, a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on generating new data similar to training data, is having an impact not only in text generation and image generation but also 3d model generation in the design industry.

    In the realm of architectural design, especially in the <code>phase of initial design</code>, generative AI can serve as a useful tool for examining many design options.

    Leveraging the Deep Signed Distance Functions model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05103.pdf">DeepSDF</a>) with latent vectors, this project aims to <code>build the algorithm that can synthesize infinite number of skyscrapers</code> simliar to trained data.
    These vectors, mapped within a high-dimensional latent space, serve as the DNA for synthesizing potential skyscrapers. 
    
    <br><br>
    
    So, through the system that manipulates the latent vectors for expressing the shape of the buildings, architectural designers can rapidly generate and examine a diverse array of design options.

    <br><br>
    By manipulating(interpolation, and arithmetic operations) between two or more latent vectors, the model gives us infinite design options virtually. 
    This method not only enhances the efficiency of the design process but also encourages the exploration of novel architectural forms and structures previously unattainable through conventional design methodologies.

<h3>Understanding Signed Distance Functions</h3>
<div class="article">
    In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_distance_function">wikipedia</a>, Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) is defined as follows:
    <br><br>

    In mathematics and its applications, the signed distance function (or oriented distance function) is the orthogonal distance of a given point x to the boundary of a set Ω in a metric space, with the <code>sign determined by whether or not x is in the interior of Ω</code>. 
    The function has positive values at points x inside Ω, it decreases in value as x approaches the boundary of Ω where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of Ω. However, the alternative convention is also sometimes taken instead (i.e., negative inside Ω and positive outside).

    At the core of SDFs lies their simplicity and power in <code>describing complex geometries.</code> 
    Unlike traditional mesh representations, which rely on vertices, edges, and faces to define forms, by using SDFs, we can construct 3d mesh models with a continuous surface, and it just needs 3D grid-shaped <code>XYZs and their corresponding SDF values.</code>

    <br><br>
    
    Let's take a look at the following example for the CCTV headquarters by OMA recovered from SDF = 0.
    Initially, to obtain SDF values, the entire space around the CCTV headquarters model is sampled on a <code>regular grid</code> (In this example, resolution indicates the number of grid points. i.e., resolution 8 means 8x8x8 grid). 
    At each grid point, the SDF provides a value that indicates the point's distance from the closest surface of the model. 
    Inside the model, these values are negative (or positive, depending on the convention), and outside, they are positive (or negative).

    <br><br>

    As you can see in the below figure, more grid points result in more detailed and accurate 3d models. 
    The numbers of the grid points used in examples are respectively <code>8x8x8(=512), 16x16x16(=4096), 32x32x32(=32768), 64x64x64(=262144), 128x128x128(=2097152).</code>
