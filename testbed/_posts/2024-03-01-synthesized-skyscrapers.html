<h3>Introduction üè¢</h3>
<div class="article">

    <code>Deep Generative AI</code>, a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on generating new data similar to training data, is having an impact not only in text generation and image generation but also 3d model generation in the design industry.

    In the realm of architectural design, especially in the <code>phase of initial design</code>, generative AI can serve as a useful tool for examining many design options.

    <br><br>

    Leveraging the Deep Signed Distance Functions model (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.05103.pdf">DeepSDF</a>), this project aims to <code>build the system that can synthesize infinite number of skyscrapers</code> simliar to trained data.

    <br><br>
    These vectors, encapsulated within a high-dimensional latent space, serve as the DNA for potential skyscraper designs. 

    <br><br>
    By <code>interpolating</code> or <code>arithmetically operating</code> between two or more latent spaces, the model gives us infinite design options theoretically. 
    This method not only enhances the efficiency of the design process but also encourages the exploration of novel architectural forms and structures previously unattainable through conventional design methodologies.

    <br><br>
    
    So, through the system that manipulates the latent vectors for expressing the shape of the buildings, architectural designers can rapidly generate and examine a diverse array of design options.

    <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><i>"I have no geometric imagination..."</i></p> 
    I often feel this way, especially when facing complex geometry problems or writing code that deals with shapes and spaces.

    At least for me, it is not easy to picture complex 3D shapes in my mind. This is a big challenge and why visualization is so useful.
    <br><br>

    I think visualizing geometry is key to solving problems. 
    Seeing what I am doing makes a huge difference. General debugging tools like <code>print</code> don't help much here. 
    They give me numbers and text but don't show me the geometry I need to see. -->
