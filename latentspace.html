        I think the term <i>latent space</i> appropriately encompasses my interests.

        Here, <i>space</i> is a term that bridges three domains I'm interested in: 
        1) the latent space of <i>machine learning</i>, where hidden representations within data are encoded; 
        2) the physical <i>space of architecture</i>, which organizes human experience and behavior; 
        and 3) the design space of <i>optimization</i>, where parametric configurations are explored to satisfy objectives.

        <br><br>

        Despite their differences, all three can be interpreted through a <i>geometric perspective</i>, allowing them to be integrated into a unified framework for <i>computational design</i> thinking.
        I hope this page itself can function as a <i>latent space</i>, where each note or project acts as a <i>latent vector</i>â€”and through their combinations, both similar and unexpected notions may emerge, revealing something interesting.
