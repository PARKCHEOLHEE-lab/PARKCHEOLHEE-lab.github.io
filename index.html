        <h3>Abstract </h3>
        This study is meaningful in providing a <code>new perspective on architecture</code> by changing the customary view of architectural spaces and programs through analysis and understanding of computational design.

        The physical environment and social constraints that make up the
        city today (in the fields of politics, economy, society, environment,
        etc.) are affecting all industries, including architecture. <code>These
        factors act as an unthinkable series of external conditions separate
        from architecture</code> and greatly influence the determination of the
        condition of a city and a building.Examples include the high urban
        environment, population density and expensive land price in Seoul, which
        created a landscape of high-rise apartment complexes, and the creation
        of a large residential cluster around the Dutch and Belgian border and
        the Hong Kong border.
