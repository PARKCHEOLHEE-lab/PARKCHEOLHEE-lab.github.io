        This study aims to explore data-driven design methods that leverage data, algorithms, and AI, etc.
        <!-- This study aims to provide a <code>new perspective on architecture</code> by changing conventional perspectives on architectural space and programs through analysis and understanding of Datascape. -->

        The physical environment and social constraints that make up the
        city today (in the fields of politics, economy, society, environment,
        etc.) are affecting all industries, including architecture. These
        factors act as an unthinkable series of external conditions separate
        from architecture and greatly influence the determination of the
        condition of a city and a building. Examples include the high-rise urban
        environment, population density and expensive land prices in Seoul, which
        created a landscape of high-rise apartment complexes, and the creation
        of a large residential cluster around the Dutch and Belgian border and
        the Hong Kong border. <br><br>
        <a href="https://semaaa.seoul.go.kr/data/upload/attach/10000/17252/20211216111911164.pdf">The FAR game</a> described the floor area ratio, a concept
        underlying building codes today, as a "constraint that triggers
        creativity," comparing it to games. The numerous constraints that make
        up a city serve as the main factor in determining design in
        architecture, and unlike medieval architecture, which was dominated by
        architectural style, contemporary architecture creates unique characteristics of a city
        (or a country) as its own distinctiveness is emphasized. This
        difference has become a landscape with a city-specific identity under
        the name of the regionality, highlighting the importance of external
        conditions in contemporary architecture. In this context, external
        conditions act as objective data in architecture making it the
        starting point for architectural design to determine the design. These
        collected data are expressed as a physical form of architecture and create a cityscape, which is named the landscape created
        by the data, the "datascape."
